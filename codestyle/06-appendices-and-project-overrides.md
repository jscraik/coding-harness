## Appendix B — Waivers (Uniform Model)

Any waiver across ESLint, Vale, Semgrep, Clippy, and CI checks MUST include these fields unless a command contract defines a tool-specific override schema:

* Rule ID
* Reason
* Ticket/issue reference
* Expiry (date) OR ADR reference

Expired waivers MUST fail CI.

Example waiver file:

```yaml
id: WAIVER-001
rule: no-unsafe-type-assertion
reason: "Temporary migration of legacy API; runtime validator landing next"
ticket: GOV-999
expires: YYYY-MM-DD
```
