## Checklist

- [ ] I did not push directly to `main`; this PR is from a dedicated branch.
- [ ] Branch name follows policy (`codex/*` for agent-created branches).
- [ ] Required local gates run: `bash scripts/validate-codestyle.sh`, `pnpm check`, `test -f memory.json && jq -e '.meta.version == "1.0" and (.preamble.bootstrap | type == "boolean") and (.preamble.search | type == "boolean") and (.entries | type == "array")' memory.json >/dev/null`.
- [ ] CodeRabbit review completed and findings handled (or explicitly waived).
- [ ] CodeRabbit review was performed by an independent reviewer (not the coding agent).
- [ ] Codex review completed and findings handled (or explicitly waived).
- [ ] Any CodeRabbit Semgrep findings were either fixed or explicitly justified when warning-level-only.
- [ ] Merge is blocked until all required checks pass.
- [ ] I will delete branch/worktree after merge.
