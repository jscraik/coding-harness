# Pull request checklist

Write for human maintainers first. Use `n.a.` with a concrete reason when a
field does not apply. Do not paste secrets, raw transcripts, bulky telemetry,
or local absolute paths.

## Behavior Proof

Complete this section when the PR changes runtime behavior, CLI behavior,
generated artifacts, validation behavior, agent workflow behavior, user-facing
docs, or any observable operator experience. Use `n.a.` with a concrete reason
for docs-only, metadata-only, or evidence-only changes where no behavior path
exists.

- Behavior before fix:
- Behavior or issue addressed:
- Real environment tested:
- Exact steps or command run after this patch:
- Evidence after fix:
- Observed result after fix:
- What was not tested:
- Proof limitations or environment constraints:

Behavior proof guidance: Behavior proof is separate from unit tests, lint,
typecheck, and CI. Use it to show the actual production path or nearest
meaningful operator path after the patch. If the exact path could not run,
state the blocker and the nearest fallback. Do not paste secrets, raw
transcripts, bulky telemetry, or local absolute paths.

- Durable evidence map:
<!-- For evidence-heavy PRs, index each local artifact inline, one entry per
line, using repo-relative paths only. Do not paste raw transcripts, secrets,
bulky telemetry, or local absolute paths.

Format per entry:
<local-path> -> <durable reference (tracked receipt / PR comment / CI URL / runtime-card ref)>;
schema/version: <value>; producer command: <value>; digest: <value>;
replay command: <value>; authority: `source-of-truth` or `retained context`.

`source-of-truth` means the artifact is authoritative for a deterministic
lane claim. `retained context` means the artifact supports review or
traceability but does not prove behavior by itself. For large PRs, prefer
splitting source/schema/CLI/validator changes from retained evidence fixtures
or generated context instead of splitting only by feature area. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] I did not push directly to `main`; this PR is from a dedicated branch.
- [ ] Branch name follows policy (`codex/*` for agent-created branches).
- [ ] Required local gates run: `bash scripts/validate-codestyle.sh`, `pnpm check`, `bash scripts/run-harness-gate.sh tooling-audit --path . --json`.
- [ ] `scripts/validate-codestyle.sh` was treated as the enforcement point for hook env sanitization (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, and related `GIT_*` values are untrusted and sanitized before `pnpm run`).
- [ ] Any CodeRabbit Semgrep findings were either fixed or explicitly justified when warning-level-only.
- [ ] North-star learning loop considered for changed files; relevant learning gate, review-context, promotion, or feedback evidence is listed below, or marked `n.a.` with a reason.
- [ ] This change is user-facing and I added a changelog entry.
- [ ] This change is not user-facing.
- [ ] Merge is blocked until all required checks pass.
- [ ] I will delete branch/worktree after merge.

## Testing
