# Pull request checklist

Write for human maintainers first. Use `n.a.` with a concrete reason when a
field does not apply. Do not paste secrets, raw transcripts, bulky telemetry,
or local absolute paths.

## Motivation

- Motivation:
- Reasoning:
- Chosen approach:

## Summary

- Problem:
- Why now:
- Intended outcome:
- Out of scope:
- Reviewer focus:
- Risk and rollback:

## Behavior Proof

Complete this section when the PR changes runtime behavior, CLI behavior,
generated artifacts, validation behavior, agent workflow behavior, user-facing
docs, or any observable operator experience. Use `n.a.` with a concrete reason
for docs-only, metadata-only, or evidence-only changes where no behavior path
exists.

- Behavior or issue addressed:
- Real environment tested:
- Exact steps or command run after this patch:
- Evidence after fix:
- Observed result after fix:
- What was not tested:
- Proof limitations or environment constraints:
- Before evidence, if available:

Behavior proof guidance: Behavior proof is separate from unit tests, lint,
typecheck, and CI. Use it to show the actual production path or nearest
meaningful operator path after the patch. If the exact path could not run,
state the blocker and the nearest fallback. Do not paste secrets, raw
transcripts, bulky telemetry, or local absolute paths.

## Checklist

- [ ] I did not push directly to `main`; this PR is from a dedicated branch.
- [ ] Branch name follows policy (`codex/*` for agent-created branches).
- [ ] Required local gates run: `bash scripts/validate-codestyle.sh`, `pnpm check`, `bash scripts/run-harness-gate.sh tooling-audit --path . --json`.
- [ ] `scripts/validate-codestyle.sh` was treated as the enforcement point for hook env sanitization (`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, and related `GIT_*` values are untrusted and sanitized before `pnpm run`).
- [ ] Any CodeRabbit Semgrep findings were either fixed or explicitly justified when warning-level-only.
- [ ] North-star learning loop considered for changed files; relevant learning gate, review-context, promotion, or feedback evidence is listed below, or marked `n.a.` with a reason.
- [ ] Merge is blocked until all required checks pass.
- [ ] I will delete branch/worktree after merge.

## Testing

- verification_commands:
- verification_outcomes:
- blocked_steps_reason:
<!-- Add one or more evidence lines such as:
- Command: `bash scripts/validate-codestyle.sh` -> pass
- Command: `pnpm check` -> blocked (reason)
- Command: `bash scripts/run-harness-gate.sh tooling-audit --path . --json` -> n.a. (reason)
-->
- Any other command(s):

## Review artifacts

- Review status:
  - CodeRabbit review: pending completion and finding resolution or waiver.
  - Independent reviewer: pending confirmation that review was performed outside the coding agent.
  - Codex review: pending completion and finding resolution or waiver.
